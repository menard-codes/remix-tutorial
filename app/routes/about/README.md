# Directories in the `routes` folder

Remix uses file-based routing. But you can add directories inside the `routes` folder. Just add a `route.tsx` file in it and that will be rendered for that directory's route.

Just like in this directory, it is nested within `routes/about`, but there's a `route.tsx` file in it, so that will be rendered in this route. You can also add relevant files in this directory.
